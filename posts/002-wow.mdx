description: 'Using a Netlify NextJS template to create a blog'

mattblack.io was created with a [Blog template designed by Bejamas](https://github.com/netlify-templates/nextjs-blog-theme/generate)

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) v12
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) v3.0
- Built-in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) v1 support

It's a great starter. Here are a few things I changed. For example, the posts needed to be sorted. The template includes a filename format for the post files:

```
posts/
  000-example.mdx
  001-cool.mdx
  002-wow.mdx
```

By default the index page of the template does not sort by the filenames, so I added a bit of code to show the most recent articles first - "above the fold":

```jsx
<ul className="w-full">
  {posts
    .sort((a, b) => (a.filePath > b.filePath ? -1 : 1))
    .map((post) => (
      // ...
    ))}
</ul>
```

Now that I've writted this code example, I've found a CSS issue with code block on mobile. The `pre` tag width is exceeding the screen width. I'll have to revist this issue in the future.

On to greater things for now!
