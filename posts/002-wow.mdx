title: Bejamas SEO NextJS Blog Template
description: 'I started this blog with a template from Bejamas. Great SEO.'

mattblack.io was created with a [Blog template designed by Bejamas](https://github.com/netlify-templates/nextjs-blog-theme/generate)

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) v12
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) v3.0
- Built-in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) v1 support

It's a great starter. There are a few things I changed, including the default theme colors. I also wanted the posts to be sorted. The template includes a filename format for the post files:

```
posts/
  000-example.mdx
  001-cool.mdx
  002-wow.mdx
```

So I added a bit of code to show the most recent articles "above the fold" first:

```jsx
<ul className="w-full">
  {posts
    .sort((a, b) => (a.filePath > b.filePath ? -1 : 1))
    .map((post) => (
      // ...
    ))}
</ul>
```

On to other things for now!
